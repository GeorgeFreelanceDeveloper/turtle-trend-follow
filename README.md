## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameters and settings

- **Stock indices**: The strategy works with predefined top 10 stocks from index (e.g. SP500, NASDAQ100, Momentum indices).
- **Breakout periods**: User-selectable lengths for entry and exit signals (e.g. YEARLY = 250-day entry, 125-day exit).
- **Benchmark filter**: Optional filter that allows purchases only when the benchmark (e.g. SPMO) is above its 200-day SMA.
- **Leverage**: Allows you to set the leverage for positions.

---

## üìà Indicators

- **Donchian Channel (DCH)**: For each symbol, the upper and lower bands are calculated based on the selected breakout period.
- **SMA200**: Used for the benchmark filter, if activated.

---

## üß† Strategy Logic

### 1. **Entry Condition (Buy Condition)**:
- The closing price is **above the upper band** of the Donchian Channel.
- The benchmark is **above the 200-day SMA** (if the filter is active).
- The position is no longer open (not long).

### 2. **Exit Condition (Sell Condition)**:
- The closing price is **below the lower band** of the Donchian Channel.
- The benchmark is still above the SMA200 (if the filter is active).

---

## üíº Position Management

- **Entry**: If conditions are met, the position is set using `set_holdings` evenly across all stocks in the basket, taking into account the leverage effect.
- **Exit**: If exit conditions are met, the position is **completely closed** using `liquidate`.

---

## üß™ Backtesting Settings

- **Start date**: 5 years back from the current year.
- **Initial capital**: $10,000.
- **Daily data**: Daily resolution is used for all stocks.

---
